I am a fourth year PhD student in Economics at [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/de/professuren/vwl/wipo) where I am advised by [Prof. Lutz Weinke](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/de/professuren/vwl/wipo/team/lutz-weinke). I am also affiliated with the [German Institute for Economic Research](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.619412.de/graduate_center.html) (DIW Berlin) as a PhD fellow. In the fall semester 2022, I  visited [Princeton University](https://economics.princeton.edu/), following an invitation from [Prof. Gianluca Violante](https://sites.google.com/a/princeton.edu/glviolante/). I am passionate about the potential of New Keynesian models with household heterogeneity to address the interaction between macroeconomic aggregates and inequality.

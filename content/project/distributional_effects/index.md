# abstract: Draft available upon request. <br> <br> I study the transmission mechanism of Quantitative Easing (QE) in the form of large-scale asset purchases in the mortgage market to aggregate consumption. I build a New Keynesian model with heterogeneous households, a microfounded housing market, and frictional intermediation. This model provides a theory for the empirical evidence that QE transmits to aggregate consumption through increasing house prices. I find that higher house prices account for around half of the stimulative effects of QE with higher labor income accounting for the remaining half.
